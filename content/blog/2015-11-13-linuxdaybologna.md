# Linux Day Bologna


Saturday, 24 october was throughout Italy the day of [Linux Day](http://www.linuxday.it/), an event that for 14 years has been promoting Linux and free software ... .. but not only that! :)

More than 90 groups of fans across Italy will have committed to deliver engaging experiences with the aim of spreading a more open approach to digital culture, animated by a spirit of sharing!

In Bologna, the whole initiative has been carried out with commitment from [Erlug association](http://www.erlug.linux.it/) that organized the celebrations for the [Linux Day](http://erlug.linux.it/linuxday/2015/) in the computer labs of the Institute [Belluzzi Fioravanti](http://www.belluzzifioravanti.it/)!

The events were many and were attended by young and old ... all in a really cool and fun atmosphere!

Among the realities present in the festivities as well as Erlug was [RaspiBo](http://www.raspibo.org/). We were there to [CoderDojo Bologna](http://www.coderdojobologna.it/)!


* ?? Our mentor could not just be run a party full of open source !! ?? *

So, thanks to Erlug, we organized an event to also show our "ninjas" (= children visitors), small programmers of the future, that sharing and remixing are not only principles of CoderDojo or the Scratch community, but are also the basis of many highly successful "large" projects. 

Linux Day gave us a fantastic window on the results that can be achieved by combining some elements such as the active collaboration, commitment to an alternative study, the invitation to experimentation and the freedom 'offered by free software.

We could see the great lessons of sharing through the various presentations: like those of a "teaching different" from University [Prof. Davoli](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renzo_Davoli) of Bologna, he has always been an evangelist of effective ways to teach informatics / computer science.

There were also beautiful demo projects in the Linux world developed in recent years by students, professors and alumni of the Institute Belluzzi-Fioravanti. Not to forget the technical interventions of veteran professionals.

Friends of the RaspiBo project have exhibited their work: cool stuff, fascinated and  passionate young and old visitors played throughout the day with robots, 3D printers and many other compelling projects.

In the afternoon, we at CoderDojo Bologna we celebrated the Linux Day!

To continue with the recurring theme of this "super day" we chose to propose a "Free Style" Dojo to give the "ninjas" (participants) a chance to give full rein to their creativity!

Mentors were Alessandro, Marco, Raffaele, Daniel, Panda, Fabio (directly from neo-Dojo Monte SanPietro) and the ever-present black belt ninja James. They  told the young Scratch users what an OS is and why' Linux has an national party day of its own which we alle love to celebrate.

After getting to know more about the world of Linux, the "ninjas" were encouraged to push their creativity to the extreme limits  ... in complete freedom!

This Linux-Dojo mentors have not proposed a tutorial, nor a theme ... every "ninja" chose independently a project of his own to start coding. And some choose to get help from other participants for their projects.


Events such as the Linux Day are a special occasions for us mentors of CoderDojo Bologna. They give us the opportunity to raise awareness not only among the "ninjas" but also among their families about those issues that are so dear to us, such as:
  * the enhancement of individual creative expression even when they are "outside the box"
  * and the importance of collaboration and sharing even when working on different projects.

To see the full program of LinuxDay 2015 and relive this wonderful experience thanks to the content provided by the speakers please click [this link](http://erlug.linux.it/linuxday/2015/index.html#programma)

May every day be a Linux Day !!! :)

Be Cool
